# WouldYouRather Project

My final assessment project for Udacity's React & Redux course.
This is a web app that lets a user play the “Would You Rather?” game.
The game goes like this: A user is asked a question in the form: “Would you rather [option A] or [option B] ?”. Answering "neither" or "both" is against the rules.

In this app, users will be able to

- answer questions,
- see which questions they haven’t answered,
- see how other people have voted,
- post questions, and
- see the ranking of users on the leaderboard.
